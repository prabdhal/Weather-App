# Weather-app
A weather app created using REST API from openweathermap API and google maps API. 
You can search for a city and the app will return the weather information for that 
city, such as, current temperature, high-low temperatures, wind speed, atmospheric 
pressure, humidity, feels-like temp, sunrise and sunset time.
